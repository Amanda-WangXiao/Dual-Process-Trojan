# Dual-Process-Trojan
A simple Trojan program. It's just for coding exercise rather than attacking others' computer.  
# Introduction  
The remote communication between the server and the client can be established through socket, and the client can control the server through remote command, including remote message transmission, file transfer, remote CMD control authority acquisition, etc. It can detect the current idle port and use the existing port to start socket communication, modify the registry to achieve the default start of the Trojan, associated with all kinds of file opening and realise the Trojan dual-process daemon and prevent the end of the process.  
通过socket建立服务端与客户端的远程通信，通过远程命令实现客户端对服务器的控制，其中包括远程消息传送、文件传输、远程cmd控制权限获取等。可以检测当前闲置端口并使用已存在端口进行socket通讯，修改注册表实现木马的默认启动，与各类文件打开方式相关联，实现了木马的双进程守护及防止进程结束。
